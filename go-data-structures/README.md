# go-data-structures

This repo hosts go implementations of commonly used data structures. \
The implementations are guided by Flavio Copes' [blog](https://flaviocopes.com/golang-data-structures/) on the topic.

## Execution
Each data structure has an accompanying \_test.go file.
Using the graph implementation as an example:

```bash
cd graph
go test
```

## TODO
revisit implementations and refactor to include go generics.
