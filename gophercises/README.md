# gophercises

This repository holds my implementations of the [gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises) series of tutorials \
`ex1` - timed cli quiz. \
`ex2` - URL shortener i.e., implement a server with endpoints that will redirect the client to another address. \
This is useful for shortening URLs and being able to rewrite links such that they all start with the same domain. \
